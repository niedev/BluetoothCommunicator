/**
 * This class represents a device that we can find, with which we can establish a connection, and communicate (obviously in that order).
 * <br /><br />
 * Usually there is no need to create a peer, in fact we should start using it when it is found (BluetoothCommunicator.onPeerFound), later we can use the
 * found peer to request a connection (BluetoothCommunicator.connect) to the latter and if the peer accepts the connection request
 * (BluetoothCommunicator.onConnectionSuccess) then we can start exchanging messages with him and eventually make a disconnection.
 * <br /><br />
 * To understand if one peer is equivalent to another we should compare the uniqueName of the two peers, this is because the device
 * can vary over time and name could have a homonym.
