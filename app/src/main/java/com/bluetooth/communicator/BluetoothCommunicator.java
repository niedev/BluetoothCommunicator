/**
 * This class allows you to communicate in P2P mode between two or more android devices.
 * It also automatically implements (they are active by default) reconnection in case of temporary connection loss, reliable message sending,
 * splitting and rebuilding of long messages, sending raw data in addition to text messages and a message queue in order to always send the messages (and always in the right order)
 * even in case of connection problems (they will be sent as soon as the connection is restored)
 * <br /><br />
 * First create a bluetooth communicator object, it is the object that handles all operations of bluetooth low energy library, if you want to manage
 * the bluetooth connections in multiple activities I suggest you to save this object as an attribute of a custom class that extends Application and
 * create a getter so you can access to bluetoothCommunicator from any activity or service with:
 *  <pre>{@code
 * ((custom class name) getApplication()).getBluetoothCommunicator();
 * }</pre>
 * Next step is to initialize bluetoothCommunicator, the parameters are: a context, the name by which the other devices will see us (limited to 18 characters
 * and can be only characters listed in BluetoothTools.getSupportedUTFCharacters(context) because the number of bytes for advertising beacon is limited) and the strategy
 * (for now the only supported strategy is BluetoothCommunicator.STRATEGY_P2P_WITH_RECONNECTION)
 * <pre>{@code
 * bluetoothCommunicator = new BluetoothCommunicator(this, "device name", BluetoothCommunicator.STRATEGY_P2P_WITH_RECONNECTION);
 * }</pre>
 * Then add the bluetooth communicator callback, the callback will listen for all events of bluetooth communicator:
 * <pre>{@code
 * bluetoothCommunicator.addCallback(new BluetoothCommunicator.Callback() {
 *     @Override
 *     public void onBluetoothLeNotSupported() {
 *         super.onBluetoothLeNotSupported();
 *
 *         Notify that bluetooth low energy is not compatible with this device
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onAdvertiseStarted() {
 *         super.onAdvertiseStarted();
 *
 *         Notify that advertise has started, if you want to do something after the start of advertising do it here, because
 *         after startAdvertise there is no guarantee that advertise is really started (it is delayed)
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onDiscoveryStarted() {
 *         super.onDiscoveryStarted();
 *
 *         Notify that discovery has started, if you want to do something after the start of discovery do it here, because
 *         after startDiscovery there is no guarantee that discovery is really started (it is delayed)
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onAdvertiseStopped() {
 *         super.onAdvertiseStopped();
 *
 *         Notify that advertise has stopped, if you want to do something after the stop of advertising do it here, because
 *         after stopAdvertising there is no guarantee that advertise is really stopped (it is delayed)
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onDiscoveryStopped() {
 *         super.onDiscoveryStopped();
 *
 *         Notify that discovery has stopped, if you want to do something after the stop of discovery do it here, because
 *         after stopDiscovery there is no guarantee that discovery is really stopped (it is delayed)
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onPeerFound(Peer peer) {
 *         super.onPeerFound(peer);
 *
 *         Here for example you can save peer in a list or anywhere you want and when the user
 *         choose a peer you can call bluetoothCommunicator.connect(peer founded) but if you want to
 *         use a peer for connect you have to have peer updated (see onPeerUpdated or onPeerLost), if you use a
 *         non updated peer the connection might fail
 *         instead if you want to immediate connect where peer is found you can call bluetoothCommunicator.connect(peer) here
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onPeerLost(Peer peer){
 *         super.onPeerLost(peer);
 *
 *         It means that a peer is out of range or has interrupted the advertise,
 *         here you can delete the peer lost from a eventual collection of founded peers
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onPeerUpdated(Peer peer,Peer newPeer){
 *         super.onPeerUpdated(peer,newPeer);
 *
 *         It means that a founded peer (or connected peer) has changed (name or address or other things),
 *         if you have a collection of founded peers, you need to replace peer with newPeer if you want to connect successfully to that peer.
 *
 *         In case the peer updated is connected and you have saved connected peers you have to update the peer if you want to successfully
 *         send a message or a disconnection request to that peer.
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onConnectionRequest(Peer peer){
 *         super.onConnectionRequest(peer);
 *
 *         It means you have received a connection request from another device (peer) (that have called connect)
 *         for accept the connection request and start connection call bluetoothCommunicator.acceptConnection(peer);
 *         for refusing call bluetoothCommunicator.rejectConnection(peer); (the peer must be the peer argument of onConnectionRequest)
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onConnectionSuccess(Peer peer,int source){
 *         super.onConnectionSuccess(peer,source);
 *
 *         This means that you have accepted the connection request using acceptConnection or the other
 *         device has accepted your connection request and the connection is complete, from now on you
 *         can send messages or data (or disconnection request) to this peer until onDisconnected
 *
 *         To send messages to all connected peers you need to create a message with a context, a header, represented by a
 *         single character string (you can use a header to distinguish between different types of messages, or you can ignore
 *         it and use a random character), the text of the message, or a series of bytes if you want to send any kind of data
 *         and the peer you want to send the message to (must be connected to avoid errors), example:
 *         new Message(context,"a","hello world",peer); If you want to send message to a specific peer you have to set
 *         the sender of the message with the corresponding peer.
 *
 *         To send disconnection request to connected peer you need to call bluetoothCommunicator.disconnect(peer);
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onConnectionFailed(Peer peer,int errorCode){
 *         super.onConnectionFailed(peer,errorCode);
 *
 *         This means that your connection request is rejected or has other problems,
 *         to know the cause of the failure see errorCode (BluetoothCommunicator.CONNECTION_REJECTED
 *         means rejected connection and BluetoothCommunicator.ERROR means generic error)
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onConnectionLost(Peer peer){
 *         super.onConnectionLost(peer);
 *
 *         This means that a connected peer has lost the connection with you and the library is trying
 *         to restore it, in this case you can update the gui to notify this problem.
 *
 *         You can still send messages in this situation, all sent messages are put in a queue
 *         and sent as soon as the connection is restored
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onConnectionResumed(Peer peer){
 *         super.onConnectionResumed(peer);
 *
 *         Means that connection lost is resumed successfully
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onMessageReceived(Message message,int source){
 *         super.onMessageReceived(message,source);
 *
 *         Means that you have received a message containing TEXT, for know the sender you can call message.getSender() that return
 *         the peer that have sent the message, you can ignore source, it indicate only if you have received the message
 *         as client or as server
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onDataReceived(Message data,int source){
 *         super.onDataReceived(data,source);
 *
 *         Means that you have received a message containing DATA, for know the sender you can call message.getSender() that return
 *         the peer that have sent the message, you can ignore source, it indicate only if you have received the message
 *         as client or as server
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onDisconnected(Peer peer,int peersLeft){
 *         super.onDisconnected(peer,peersLeft);
 *
 *         Means that the peer is disconnected, peersLeft indicate the number of connected peers remained
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onDisconnectionFailed(){
 *         super.onDisconnectionFailed();
 *
 *         Means that a disconnection is failed, super.onDisconnectionFailed will reactivate bluetooth for forcing disconnection
 *         (however the disconnection will be notified in onDisconnection)
 *     }
 * });
 * }</pre>
 * Finally you can start discovery and/or advertising:
 * <pre>{@code
 * bluetoothCommunicator.startAdvertising();
 * bluetoothCommunicator.startDiscovery();
 * }</pre>
 * All other actions that can be done are explained with the comments in the code of callback I wrote before.
 * <br /><br />
 * To use this library add these permissions to your manifest:
 * <pre>{@code
 * <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
 * <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
 * <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
 * }</pre>
